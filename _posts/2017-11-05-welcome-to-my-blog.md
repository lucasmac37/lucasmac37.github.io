  Well, this is my first time trying out a blog. It took me a while to figure out how to work with jekyll, but thanks to Minimal Mistakes, I don't need to have much knowledge about front-end to get this thing going.
  Anyway, let's start with some example code here. And I'll keep posting more stuffs in the future~ :)

```python
def print_meaning_of_life():
  print "42"
print_meaning_of_life()
```
